2025年4月起大量的攻击性文字攻击2024级信科学硕某同学

攻击性文字和资料来自学院的各个地方，被攻击的人还要被指认有精神病，你们说搞笑不搞笑

重要人物：韩某、等行政人员

学院还想让别人去精神科检查，笑死。

这就是 NENU 信科的作风么？

这就是 NENU 信科的作风么？

这就是 NENU 信科的作风么？

这就是东北师范大学信息科学与技术学院的作风么？

## Since April 2025, there have reportedly been numerous aggressive text attacks targeting a 2024 Computer Science graduate student at NENU

The offensive content allegedly came from various places within the department. The person being attacked is reportedly being labeled as having mental health issues. Some administrative staff (including someone surnamed Han) are allegedly involved, and there are claims that the department wants the person to undergo psychiatric evaluation.
Is this the approach/style of NENU's Computer Science and Technology Department? Is this the approach/style of Northeast Normal University's School of Information Science and Technology?
